To solve the equation "2x + 3 = 7", follow these steps to isolate x and find its value:

1. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation.
   2x + 3 - 3 = 7 - 3
   This simplifies to: 
   2x = 4

2. Divide both sides by 2.
   2x / 2 = 4 / 2
   Simplifying further, we get:
   x = 2

So the solution is x = 2.
