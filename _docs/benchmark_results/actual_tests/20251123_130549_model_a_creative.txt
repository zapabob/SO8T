 I'm not quite sure what kind of data is in `MyData` array, but it looks like if we are dealing with numbers that have to be rendered as integers (I assume they represent some ID) how about these types:

    $array = [10^6]* 587432,
        'Lorem ipsum Lorem Ipsum' => int(9), 
         "Avatar",
            {
                // The first one is the most efficient way to do it.
     |
    $string_countries = array (10, 5436872)
        [ 'country': string,
          ['name' => '', 
              function(int($x) {
                return intval($_POST['number']);
            }, // Here we are adding the integer value of $countries as an index to a numeric array (1, 543276)
           'countryCode',   # this is how you access it in your code
          ], 
         ] => {       -> [0]=>'USA',
        "Turkey",    // I don’t know what the value should be here. It would just overwrite whatever else that was there.
      'countries', 23456,
            1, # this is my guess
            
         ] => [0]=>'Argentina'],
        "Average Rating" => array(array (['Lorem ipsum Lorem Ipsum'] as $value) {
          'id'=> 7458,
           }, //Here you can either use a regex or preg_match to find the first part of your file. 
       ) ,
      ],   # then put it into array here, but if not sure what that should be.
    10 => 'Japan',
        "Salesmen"         : [array ( 4385679,
            array(2) {
                ["name"]=>
                    ['id' => 'bh', 
                      'data'=>['Germany'],
                     // ...more data here...             ],   # this should be another object, not an int.
        },
       }), 2016-10-31=> array(array (74895)
    ];
