Newton's Second Law of Motion states that the acceleration (a) of an object is directly proportional to the net force (F) acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass (m). This can be written as:

\[ F = ma \]

Here, 'F' represents the total force applied to the object, 'm' stands for the mass of the object, and 'a' is the acceleration produced. The direction of the net force determines the direction of the acceleration.

**Concrete Example: Pushing a Shopping Cart** 
Consider pushing a shopping cart in a supermarket. When you apply more effort to push it harder (increasing F), and assuming there is no significant friction, the cart will accelerate faster according to Newton's second law.

Let’s say: 
- You exert an additional force of \(2 \, \text{N}\) on a shopping cart. 
- The mass (m) of the loaded cart including groceries is \(10 \, \text{kg}\).
   
Using Newton's second law, we can calculate acceleration: 
\[ F = ma \]
\[ 2 \, \text{N} = 10 \, \text{kg} \times a \] 
To find 'a', rearrange the formula to solve for acceleration: 
\[ a = \frac{F}{m} \] 
\[ a = \frac{2 \, \text{N}}{10 \, \text{kg}} \] 
\[ a = 0.2 \, \text{m/s}^2\]
    
So, the acceleration of the shopping cart would be \(0.2 \, \text{m/s}^2\). If you push with less force or if there is significant friction (which acts in opposition to your applied force), this will result in a smaller value for 'a', indicating slower acceleration.

This example illustrates how the quantity of mass and net external forces impact an object's movement, as per Newton’s second law. It shows that if you want to increase speed (acceleration) while pushing something with constant effort, it helps having less mass or reducing opposing friction factors like rough flooring surfaces in a supermarket setting.
