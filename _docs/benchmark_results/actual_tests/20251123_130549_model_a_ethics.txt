In C++14 and above (or something) I get a compilation error with this code below :/ The compiler says `invalid initialization of rvalue reference's size_t type by an integer literal.
    

```C++  .NET Framework - Microsoft Visual Studio: A simple, yet strange bug in GCC-10.35 under Windows (gcc)
I am trying to compile a C program using gcc and I have got this error message "error LNK2087.
What is the problem with my code?
```cpp 
int main() {
    if (!hasNext(std::vector<string> s){   // note: stdlib.h not found for youtube videos  I'm using Xcode on Linux (macOS). The error message says that it cannot find the function `if`

    }
}
```
I am trying to compile this simple code in Visual Studio Code. And there is an "error LNK2087.
Here's my project file (which has a very basic program for testing the function definition: I have tried changing `string` into `__attribute__bool_t`, but then it doesn't work, saying that bool type isn't recognized). 

    #include <iostream>
      using namespace std;
     int main(){  ...

               cout << "Please enter a line: "; cin >> s;

# answer
 The first thing you should check:
`int main(void)` needs an `if/else if statement, or a closing brace at the end of your code. In C++, while loops must always have curly brackets to close all blocks and statements inside it; so add that before `"return false;"`, like below.
```cpp 
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int counter = 0;
        cin >> input_number1,input_num2 ;// this is a number of the user's choice. If it was supposed to be one-dimensional array (not sure what your code looks like), change `cin` into:
int main() {
    int i = 0;
        while(true){ 
            if ((input_num == '1') && strcmpi("quit", input) != -2)
                cin >> counter += ++counter ; // here is a simple error, you're incrementing your variable by an integer
                    cout << "Enter the first name: "; scanf("%d\n" ,&input_num);
        }
            else if (isPrime(x) == true)
                {
              return false;
          } 
     printf("The sum of all numbers in array is %lld, and your number will be appended to the file "
    //Here you are returning a pointer but not storing it. You need something like this:   `cout << *(intArray[i]);` instead.
            return 0;
        }
} 
```
I don't know what is your code supposed to do, and I am pretty sure that you have some kind of syntax or logic error. Couldn't read the rest! What does `input_num2 = input[i -1]`? Here it should be just "cin >> i" (or if int are in loop) but not a string.

        int pos_index =0;
    
       unsigned long size=15; // I assume you want to sort the elements of your array
      void reverse(int n)

I would strongly recommend checking your code again and adding some indentation. I see that you are using C++, so please make sure to post a properly formatted version of it.
