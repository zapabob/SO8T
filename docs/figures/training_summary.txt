SO(8) Alpha Gate Training Summary
==================================================

Model: Borea-Phi-3.5-instinct-jp + SO(8) Alpha Gate
Training Duration: 1000 steps
Alpha Range: 0.1 → 0.8
Final Loss: 0.6000
Phase Transition: Step 300
Transition Ratio: 0.53

Physical Interpretation:
- Alpha Gate represents geometric constraint strength
- Phase transition occurs when constraint becomes dominant
- Loss drop indicates successful SO(8) structure integration
